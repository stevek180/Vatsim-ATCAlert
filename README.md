# Vatsim-ATCAlert

*Very much a work in progress*

This will allow VATSIM users to be audibly alerted when a controller at a particular airport comes online.  It queries VATSIM servers every thirty seconds.  

Currently a Winforms app that can listen for both GND and TWR at a given airport ICAO code.  Still slightly buggy and has some code duplication that needs refactoring.
