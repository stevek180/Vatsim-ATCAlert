# Vatsim-ATCAlert


This will allow VATSIM users to be audibly alerted when a controller at a particular airport comes online.  It queries VATSIM servers every thirty seconds.  

Starting off with a simple .NET Console app that takes an airport code and searches ONLY for Tower, i.e. "BOS_TWR".  

Will extend to be more flexible in the future, i.e. a GUI with dropdowns and multiple alerts.
