# Vatsim-ATCAlert

*Very much a work in progress*

This will allow VATSIM users to be audibly alerted when a controller at a particular airport comes online.  It queries VATSIM servers every thirty seconds.  

Starting off with a simple .NET Console app that takes an airport code and searches ONLY for Tower, i.e. "BOS_TWR".  

Now have a crude .NET Forms app that takes an airport code and listens for Tower.  Has some bugs, but sorta works.
